I tried to use 2 text-point files from OCPN-Draw.
The first one is showing text and symbols, while the other only shows text when the mouse is moved over.
The points of both files do have the same coordinates.
Every time the text-layer message of the first file is shown.
Is there a way to change the sequence, so the second file will get visible by mouse-over.

As well the system (OCPN) is not willing to close as disired, and task-manager needs to be used.

Is there a solution for both issues?

Thanks,
